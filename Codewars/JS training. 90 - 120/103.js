/* Localize The Barycenter of a Triangle
The medians of a triangle are the segments that unit the vertices with the midpoint of their opposite sides. The three medians of a triangle intersect at the same point, called the barycenter or the centroid. Given a triangle, defined by the cartesian coordinates of its vertices we need to localize its barycenter or centroid.

The function bar_triang() or barTriang or bar-triang, receives the coordinates of the three vertices A, B and C  as three different arguments and outputs the coordinates of the barycenter O in an array [xO, yO]

This is how our asked function should work: the result of the coordinates should be expressed up to four decimals, (rounded result).

You know that the coordinates of the barycenter are given by the following formulas.
Let's see some cases:

barTriang([4, 6], [12, 4], [10, 10]) ------> [8.6667, 6.6667]

barTriang([4, 2], [12, 2], [6, 10]) ------> [7.3333, 4.6667] */

function barTriang(p1, p2, p3) {
    return [
        ((p1[0] + p2[0] + p3[0]) / 3).toFixed(4) * 1,
        ((p1[1] + p2[1] + p3[1]) / 3).toFixed(4) * 1,
    ];
}
